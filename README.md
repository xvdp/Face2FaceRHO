## Face2Face<sup>&rho;</sup>: Official Pytorch Implementation / @xvdp mod to work with pytorch >= 2.0
[<img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/paper-ECCV-black'>](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136730055.pdf)

### Environment
- CUDA 10.2 or above (@xvdp works with 11.8)
- Python 3.8.5 (@xvdp 3.9.15)
- ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (@xvdp removed freezepoints)
- For visdom, some dependencies may need to be manually 
    downloaded ([visdom issue](https://github.com/fossasia/visdom/issues/111))
    
### Training data
Our framework relies on a large video dataset containing many identities, 
such as [VoxCeleb](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/). For each video frame, the following data is required:
  - image: the cropped face image (please refer to the pre-processing steps of 
    [Siarohin et al.](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/video-preprocessing))
  - landmark: the 2D facial landmark coordinates obtained via projecting the 3D keypoints on the
    fitted 3DMM mesh to the image space. (please refer to Section 3.3
    of our paper)
  - headpose: 3DMM head pose coefficients
  - face mask (optional): the face area mask (can be generated by any face parsing methods, such as 
    [BiSeNet](https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch)).
    

The pre-processed data should be organized as follows (an 
example dataset containing two video sequences is provided in ```./dataset/VoxCeleb```):

```
   - dataset
       - <dataset_name>
           - list.txt                             ---list of all videos 
           - id10001#7w0IBEWc9Qw#000993#001143    ---video folder 1 (should be named as <person_id>#<video_id>)
               - img                              ---video frame
                   - 1.jpg
                   - 2.jpg
                   - ...
               - landmark                         ---landmark coordinates for each frame 
                   - 1.txt
                   - 2.txt
                   - ...
               - headpose                         ---head pose coefficients for each frame 
                   - 1.txt
                   - 2.txt
                   - ...
               - mask                             ---face mask for each frame 
                   - 1.png
                   - 2.png
                   - ...
            - id10009#AtavJVP4bCk#012568#012652   ---video folder 2
               ...
                    
```
### Training
- Set training data  
    - Set ```dataroot``` in ```./src/config/train_face2facerho.ini``` to ```./dataset/<dataset_name>``` (e.g. ```dataroot=./dataset/VoxCeleb```)
- Setup vidsom  
    - Set visdom ```<port_number>``` to ```display_port``` in ```./src/config/train_face2facerho.ini```, and run:
  ```bash
  nohup python -m visdom.server -port <port_number> &
  ```
- Start training (tested with Tesla V100)
    ```bash
    python src/train.py --config ./src/config/train_face2facerho.ini
    ```

### Testing
- Prepare models
  - Download our pre-trained models from [GooleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1asCyEjKxpKSV8g674WwmmCgxAZP9pf9x) and put it in ```./src/checkpoints/voxceleb_face2facerho```
  - Download [FLAME model](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php), 
    choose **FLAME 2020** and unzip it, copy 'generic_model.pkl' into ```./src/external/data```
  - Download [DECA trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rp8kdyLPvErw2dTmqtjISRVvQLj6Yzje/view?usp=sharing), 
    and put it in ```./src/external/data``` (**no unzip required**)
- Fit the 3DMM coefficients of the source and driving face images
  - Since the code of the 3DMM fitting algorithm used in our paper was taken from our company’s in-house facial performance 
    capture system, we can only release them after getting our company’s official permission. Alternatively, we provide an 
    open-source solution based on [DECA](https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA). However, the overall performance of our framework may be slightly poorer with DECA. On the one hand, our original 3DMM fitting algorithm is more accurate and stable than DECA; on the other, the pre-configured 72 keypoints are not exactly the same as our original configuration because the mesh templates are different.
    

Note that the resulting 
    quality may deteriorate by using DECA 3DMM fitting algorithm, since our original 3DMM fitting algorithm is more 
    stable and robust than DECA, and the pre-configured 72 keypoints on the FLAME mesh template are also slightly 
    different from our original configuration.
